# Xenapi for PHP

A Xen PHP API for managment of Hypervisor and Citrix Server and their Virtual Machines for PHP, it works on Laravel 4, Laravel 5, Codeigniter and other PHP framework.
Before install this library make sure to have installed *xmlrpc php* module

API in PHP to communicate with Xen Server . 
This packages is available on Composer's repositories .
The package Allows to completely Manage an Hypervisvor Citrix .
With this , you can clone , start , stop and reboot any VPS of your Hypervisor
Also, this APi allow you toi have a realtime graph of your Hypervisor's VPS!
I've create the Method that obtain XML realtime stats of Machine and convert it to RRD file, needed for the FlotJS library to draw the graph.
This API is available for all the major PHP Frameworks, such as Laravel, Symfony or Codeigniter.

## Installation :

Package is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/sircamp/xenapi),
you can install it using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

In the **require** key of **composer.json** file add the following:

```php
"sircamp/xenapi": "3.0"
```
Or type this command from your project folder

```bash
composer require sircamp/xenapi
```

## Documentation: 

#### Namespace Import
Sircamp\Xenapi is namespaced, but you can make your life easier by importing
a single class into your context:

```php
use Sircamp\Xenapi\Xen as Xen;
```

#### Connect With an Hypervisor

Make sure that you have IP, User and Password of your hypervisor:

```php
$ip = "123.123.123.123";
$user = "username";
$password = "password";
$xen = new Xen($ip,$user,$password); //OK now you have an open connection to Hypervisor
```

#### Get Virtual Machine 

This serves to have a virtual machine (by the hostname) that is on selected hypervisor :

```php
$vm = $xen->getVMByNameLabel("virtual.machine.hostaname");
```


#### Virtual Machine Management

Now you have the an XenVirtualMachine object that map your virtual machine, so we are ready to manage the VM

##### Start VM

This method starts a stopped VM

```php
$vm->start(); 
```
You can, also, pass two parameters at this method:
```php
$pause = true; // start VM in pause status , dafault is false
$force = true; // force the boot of VM, default is true
$vm->start($pause, $force); 
```

##### StartOn VM

This method starts the specified VM on a particular host. This function can only be called with the VM is in the Halted State.
*This method needs an XenHost object as parameter, but if you want you can pass a UUID host string*

```php
$host // this is a XenHost object istance or a string istance
$hostRef = $host;
$pause = true; // start VM in pause status , dafault is false
$force = true; // force the boot of VM, default is true
$vm->startOn($hostRef,$pause, $force); 
```

##### Shutdown VM

This method sends a shutdown command to the Virtual Machine

```php
$vm->cleanShutdown(); 
```

##### Hard Shutdown VM
This method immediatly a shutdown  the Virtual Machine

```php
$vm->hardShutdown(); 
```

##### Reboot VM
This method sends a reboot command to the Virtual Machine
```php
$vm->cleanShutdown(); 
```

##### Hard Reboot VM

This method immediatly restarts  the Virtual Machine

```php
$vm->hardShutdown(); 
```

##### Suspend VM

This method puts Virtual Machine in a suspend mode (read the Citrix manual)

```php
$vm->suspend(); 
```

##### Resume VM

This method resumes a Virtual Machine that is in a suspend mode (read the Citrix manual)

```php
$vm->resume(); 
```
##### ResumeOn VM

This method awaken the specified VM and resume it on a particular Host. This can only be called when the specified VM is in the Suspended state.
*This method needs an XenHost object as parameter, but if you want you can pass a UUID host string*

```php
$host // this is a XenHost object istance or a string istance
$hostRef = $host;
$vm->resumeOn($hostRef); 
```

##### Pause VM

This method puts a Virtual Machine in pause 

```php
$vm->pause(); 
```

##### Unpause VM

This method restores a Virtual Machine that is in pause

```php
$vm->unpause(); 
```

##### Clone VM

This method clones the selected Virtual Machine into another ( please check if your hypervisor supports another machine).

before this, you must stop the virtual machine that you want clone

```php
$name = "new_cloned_vm"; // name of cloned vm
$vm->cleanShudown(); // stop  vm
$vm->clonevm($name); 
```

##### Power Status of VM

This method gets the power status of the selected Virtual Machine 

```php
$vm->getPowerState();
```

##### Power State Reset of VM

Reset the power-state of the VM to halted in the database only. (Used to recover from slave failures in pooling scenarios by resetting the power-states of VMs running on dead slaves to halted.) This  is a potentially dangerous operation; use with care.

```php
$vm->powerStateReset();
```

##### UUID of VM

This method obtains the UUID of the selected Virtual Machine.


```php
$vm->getUUID();
```

##### Consoles of VM

This method returns the all console instances of  selected Virtual Machine.
The console istance allows you to have  and manage a SSH or RDP session of Virtual Machine


```php
$vm->getConsoles()
```
##### UUID of VM Console

This method returns the UUID of selected Virtual Machine's console.
The UUID is very usefull for console istance mangement.

```php
$vm->getConsoleUUID($console)
```

##### Guest Metrics of VM

This method returns the guest metrics of selected Virtual Machine.
This metrics contains:

+ uuid
+ os_version (name, uname, distro, relase version)
+ memory
+ disks
+ networks
+ other

*in the future, i will write an example*

```php
$vm->getGuestMetrics()
```


##### Metrics of VM

This method returns the metrics of selected Virtual Machine.
This metrics contains:

+ uuid
+ memory_actual

+ VCPUs_utilisation

*as for guest metrics, in the future, i will write an example*

```php
$vm->getMetrics()
```
##### Statistics of VM 

This method returns the current stats of the running selected Virtual Machine.
With this method, you can obtain the stats of  CPUs, RAM and DISK I/O  in ***realtime***!

However, this method return an response object that contains a XML string in the ***value*** attribute.
Inside this XML string you find the required statistics.

*as for last two methods, in the future, i will write an example. Also, i would to show you how to obtain a realtime stats graph, stay tuned ;)*

```php
$vm->getStats()
```
##### Disks Total Space of VM

This method returns the total amount of Virtual Machine's Disks space.
Actually this method return the total in bytes.

```php
$vm->getDiskSpace()
```
Also, you can pass an argument:

```php
$format = "GB";
$vm->getDiskSpace($format);
```
This allow you to have the disk space in the format as you want.
**NB: this feature is not yet implemented**

```php
$optionsMap = array(
	'option1' => "option first",
	'option2' => "option second"
)
$host // this is a XenHost object istance or a string istance
$hostRef = $host;
$vm->poolMigrate($refHost, $optionsMap);
```

In this method the first parameter, *dest*, is the result of a **Host.migrate** receive call.
The *vdiMap* parameter is the map of source VDI to destination SR.
The *vifMap* parameter is the map of VIF to destination network.
The *optionsMap*  Extra configuration operations.
The *live* parameter allows to migrate the VM in *live mode* or nothing, on default this paramter is set to *false*.

```php
$dest // Host.migrate call result
$vdiMap //map of source VDI
$vifMap //map of source VFI
$options = array(

#### Response Management

Every method return an istance of *XenResponse* class.
This object contains three attributes:

+ Value
+ Status
+ ErrorDescription

##### Value attribute
This attribute contains the value of response, sach as message, XML string or something else.

use this method to obtain it:
```php
$response = $vm->hardReboot();
$response->getValue();
```
##### Status attribute
This attribute contains the status of response.
If status is **Success** the request is OK.
Otherwise is request is KO, use this for check the result of your operations

use this method to obtain it:
```php
$response = $vm->hardReboot();
$response->getStatus();
```
##### ErrorDescription attribute
This attribute contains message of KO response.
Just take the value of this attribute and check why the response isn't OK.

For example if your connection credentials are wrong:
```php
$console = "wrong_console";
$response = $vm->getConsolesUUID($console);
$response->getStatus(); //return Failure
$response->getErrorDescription(); // return an array with some error message
```

#### Exceptions

This is exaplained the custom excetions

##### XenConnectionException

This exception is launched when you try to connect to a hypervisor with a wrong credentials.

To catch this exception, remember to use the namespace of this class:
```php
use Sircamp\Xenapi\Exception\XenConnectionException as XenConnectionException;
```
